JSP standards, Actions, XML and EL

    STANDARD ACTIONS
        Standard actions are used for the same purpose as Java language scripting
        <jsp:useBean>, <jsp:setBean>, <jsp:getBean>

            BEANS
                Are designed to instantiate Java objects.
                The idea is that you can have Java components (classes), using reflection.
                By interrogating the methods available on a JavaBean, a standard action can obtain information about the properties that the bean support
                All the beans has to do the getter and setter.

            STANDARD ACTIONS
                Syntax: <prefix:tagname firstAttribute="value" secondAttribute="value"> ... </prefix:tagname>
                <jsp:useBean/>
                    Standard actions declares a JavaBean intance and associate this with a variable name.
                    The JavaBean is available for use elsewhere in your JSP page like EL or scriptlets
                    Usage
                        <jsp:useBean id="theDog" class="animals.Dog" />
                        id -> unique identifier
                        class -> the class you are instantiating.
                    As a jsp translation result, some complex code at the _jspService method.
                    If no scope is defined, the page scope is added
                    If the bean already exist, no other bean is created.

                <jsp:setProperty/>
                    Set a property to a specific bean.
                    Usage
                        <jsp:setProperty name="theDog" property="weight" value="6.4" />
                        name -> the bean id.
                        property -> the property on the bean.
                        value -> the value assigned to the property.
                    Some examples:
                        <jsp:setProperty name="theDog" property="weight" value="<%= request.getParameter("dogWeight") %>" />
                        is equals than
                        <jsp:setProperty name="theDog" property="weight" param="dogWeight" />

                <jsp:getProperty/>
                    Get a value from a specific bean
                    <jsp:getProperty name="theDog" property="weight" />

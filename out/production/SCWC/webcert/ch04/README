DISTRIBUTABLE SESSIONS

    It's possible to define a web application as distributable if it is supported by the application server. Use the <distributable/>
    Run under different JavaVM.
    Why use distributable sessions? If the the first running instance fail, then go the to the other server instance.

SESSION DEATH
    Use the HttpSession.invalidate() when you need to logoff or when you need to finish a session. (If you try to access the HttpSession methods, an IllegalStateException will throw)
    The session also dies when the client close the browser window. So when reopen the browser is treated as a new session.
    There are 3 ways to invalidate a session through timeout.
        1. In the Application Server: different for every server
        2. Web Deployment Descriptor: by the <session-config>'s <session-timeout> tag
        3. Individual session setting: using HttpSession.getMaxInteractiveInteval(int seconds)
